    """
    Unified Toolset for the postgres Data Analytics Multi-Agent System

    This class provides a standardized set of tools and functions for agents within a multi-agent system 
    that interacts with a Postgres database. It offers several advantages:

    - **Shared State and Functions:** All agents have access to the same state (like database connection) 
      and functions, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.
    - **Context Awareness:** Agents can utilize functions that dynamically adapt to changing context 
      based on the current session.
    - **Clear Agent Capabilities:** Functions offer well-defined capabilities for agents, 
      facilitating easier development and understanding.
    - **Clean Database Management:** The class simplifies database connection management.

    **Guidelines:**

    - **Agent Function Isolation:** Agent functions should not directly call other agent functions. 
      Instead, they should interact with external lower-level modules.
    - **One-to-One Mapping (Optional):** Consider a one-to-one mapping between agents and their functions 
      for simpler architecture.
    - **Persistent State Lifecycle:** The state of this class persists across agent orchestrations.
